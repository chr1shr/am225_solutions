Harvard Applied Math 225: Homework solution codes
=================================================
Harvard AM225 is a graduate course in scientific computing that covers a
variety of advanced topics in numerical analysis, algorithm design, and
high-performance computing.

See the main website here:

https://courses.seas.harvard.edu/courses/am225/

This Git repository contains homework solutions from the course. The codes are
primarily written in C++ using the OpenMP library for multithreading. Some
additional programs in Python are provided.

Compiling
=========
The programs make use of the GNU Make utility for automatic building. Each
directory contains a "Makefile", which contains the compilation rules for
each program.

Each directory looks for a common configuration file called "config.mk" in the
top level of the repository, which sets the compiler name and various compiler
options.

To begin, you must create a "config.mk" file from one of the templates
provided in the "config" directory. The simplest method is to create a symlink
(shortcut) from one of the templates. On a Linux system, this can be done by
typing:

ln -s config/config.mk.linux config.mk

On a Mac system using GCC 10 installed with MacPorts (www.macports.org), use
the following:

ln -s config/config.mk.mac_mp config.mk

On a Mac system using GCC 10 installed with Homebrew (https://brew.sh), use
the following:

ln -s config/config.mk.mac_hb config.mk

For a custom configuration, copy one of the files from the "config" directory
into the root directory, and then manually edit it.

Once the "config.mk" file is created, change into one of the project
directories and type "make" to compile everything.
